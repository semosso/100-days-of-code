# 100 Days Of Code - Goals and Log

<!--### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

#**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

#**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

## Goals

Off the top of my head and without any basis to set these, here goes:

1. Five small Python projects
2. One mid Python project
3. One mid Python project involving data analysis
4. Five small front-end projects

## Daily logs (progress, thoughts)

**Day 1: December 20, 2018, Thursday**

**Progress**: During off time at work, did most of the Basic HTML and HTML5 tutorial on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Doubtful about whether I should keep working on front or back-end stuff, especially if I'll be able to find back-end projects to keep me motivated throughout.

**Day 2: December 21, 2018, Thursday**

**Progress**: During off time at work, finished Basic HTML and HTML5 tutorial on freeCodeCamp, and got about 15% of the Basic CSS (up to about the padding exercises). Later at home, did exercises 27 through 31 of LPTHW.

**Thoughts**: Cool to start understanding how HTML/CSS syntax works, and also to notice how Python is so fucking easier to write. In LPTHW, excited to begin using logic, will be important to keep in mind ideas of BRANCHES and NESTING.

**Projects**: Very dumb study drill from LPTHW just to test if-elif-else statements: <a href=https://github.com/semosso/lpthw/blob/master/ex31_new-game.py>exercise 31</a>
