# 100 Days Of Code - Goals and Log

<!--### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

#**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

#**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

#**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)-->

## Goals

Off the top of my head and without any basis to set these, here goes:

1. Five small Python projects
2. One mid Python project
3. One mid Python project involving data analysis
4. Five small front-end projects

## Daily logs (progress, thoughts)

**Day 1: December 20, 2018**

**Progress**: During off time at work, did most of the Basic HTML and HTML5 tutorial on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Doubtful about whether I should keep working on front or back-end stuff, especially if I'll be able to find back-end projects to keep me motivated throughout.

**Day 2: December 21, 2018**

**Progress**: During off time at work, finished Basic HTML and HTML5 tutorial on freeCodeCamp, and got about 15% of the Basic CSS (up to about the padding exercises). Later at home, did exercises 27 through 31 of LPTHW.

**Thoughts**: Cool to start understanding how HTML/CSS syntax works, and also to notice how Python is so fucking easier to write. In LPTHW, excited to begin using logic, will be important to keep in mind ideas of BRANCHES and NESTING.

**Projects**: Very dumb study drill from LPTHW just to test if-elif-else statements: <a href=https://github.com/semosso/lpthw/blob/master/ex31_new-game.py>exercise 31</a>

**Day 3: December 22, 2018**

**Progress**: Created a little thingy to automatize my daily log entry re: 100 days of code. Took me at least 3h.

**Thoughts**: Very excited to finally be doing something. Very cool to look online for answer to problems and to possible solutions on how to get what I wanted to do. Hope to burn through a few LPTHW exercises tomorrow.

**Project**: <a href=https://github.com/semosso/100-days-of-code/blob/master/autolog.py>Autolog</a>

**Day 4: December 23, 2018**

**Progress**: Worked on ex32 and 33 from LPTHW. Coincidence to learn while-loop just as Takai had mentioned it.

**Thoughts**: Cool study drills from ex 33, now I have to nail the difference between while and for-loop and how the increment got messed up; is it messed up or is that a difference between the structures? Try to find out tomorrow. Good to have kept streak even with 12+ hour work.

**Project**: <a href=https://github.com/semosso/lpthw/blob/master/ex33.py>ex33</a>

**Day 5: December 24, 2018**

**Progress**: Worked on Takai comments to autolog. Worked on for/while loop exercises and branches/functions exercise (34).

**Thoughts**: Iocused on streamlining things through functions. Keep that in mind.

**Project**: <a href=https://github.com/semosso/100-days-of-code/blob/master/autolog.py>Revised Autolog</a>


**Day 6: December 25, 2018**

**Progress**: Worked for about 5h on nba game (ex 36 from lpthw). Very fun and challenging, I decided to add too much to it, far more than I know.

**Thoughts**: Stack Overflow is your friend, bible, sword and axe.

**Project**: <a href=https://github.com/semosso/lpthw/blob/master/nbagame7.py>NBA game 7</a>

**Day 7: December 26, 2018**

**Progress**: WOrking on NBA game. Ended up rewriting main functions (fix_input, check_lineup, check_squad) and not advancing anything else.

**Thoughts**: Cool work, lots of texting and moving stuffing around, hopefully streamlining it. Tomorrow hope to start on scenarios.

**Project**: <a href=https://github.com/semosso/lpthw/blob/master/nbagame7.py>NBA Game 7</a>

**Day 8: December 27, 2018**

**Progress**: At least two hours working on NBA game, merged some functions (fix_input, check_lineup, check_squad), created others.

**Thoughts**: Almost there, need to figure out how to make the counter work.

**Project**: <a href=https://github.com/semosso/lpthw/blob/master/nbagame7.py>NBA Game 7</a>

**Day 9: December 28, 2018**

**Progress**: Around 2h working on the NBA Game and how to get the counter working.

**Thoughts**: Well... What I thought was working really wasn't, heh. Deleted both "gameplay" functions and will start from scratch. Maybe implementing counter inside for-loop is the answer.

**Project**: <a href=https://github.com/semosso/lpthw/blob/master/nbagame7.py>NBA Game</a>

**Day 10: December 29, 2018**

**Progress**: Finished NBA Game (fully works, although not as "complex" or clean as I once thought it would be. Satisfied though. Worked on simple virtual jar of good memories.

**Thoughts**: Tomorrow plan on getting back to LPTHW normal study routine.

**Project**: <a href=https://github.com/semosso/lpthw/blob/master/nbagame7.py>NBA Game</a> and <a href=https://github.com/semosso/stuff/blob/master/virtualjar.py>virtual jar</a>.

**Day 11: December 30, 2018**

**Progress**: Several exercises from LPTHW, starting to learn OOP.

**Thoughts**: Excited to finally start learning the MEAT of the thing.

**Project**: No project.

**Day 12 - 16: December 31, 2018 to January 4, 2019**

**Progress**: nothing.

**Thoughts**: nothing.

**Project**: nothing.

**Day 17: January 05, 2019**

**Progress**: Re-read exercises about OOP and classes. Added narratives to NBA game.

**Thoughts**: Work on exercises to memorize and identify OOP lingo. Start game with classes.

**Project**: No project.

**Day 18 - 23: January 6 to January 11, 2019**

**Progress**: nothing.

**Thoughts**: nothing.

**Project**: nothing.

**Day 1: January 12, 2019**

**Progress**: Starting 100-days-of-code all over again. Reading/studying/exercizing a lot on classes and OOP.

**Thoughts**: The meaty stuff is finally here... Hard to grasp, but full of potential.

**Project**: No project.

**Day 2: January 13, 2019**

**Progress**: Classes and OOP, and commenting ex 43 exhaustively (alien adventure game). Ideas for next projects (e.g., f1 game, chess, tennis, chap√©u seletor).

**Thoughts**: Still hard to grasp, but began to understand init functions, self, and etc.

**Project**: Not really a project, but my comments on <a href=https://github.com/semosso/lpthw/blob/master/ex43_classes.py>ex43</a> are good to keep in mind.
