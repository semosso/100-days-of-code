# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!--### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

#**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

#**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

## Goals

Off the top of my head and without any basis to set these, here goes:

1. Five small Python projects
2. One mid Python project
3. One mid Python project involving data analysis
4. Five small front-end projects

## Daily logs (progress, thoughts)

**Day 1: December 20, 2018, Thursday**

**Progress**: During off time at work, did most of the Basic HTML and HTML5 tutorial on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Doubtful about whether I should keep working on front or back-end stuff, especially if I'll be able to find back-end projects to keep me motivated throughout.

**Day 2: December 21, 2018, Thursday**
