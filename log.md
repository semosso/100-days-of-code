#**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

#**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

Progress: During off time at work, did most of the Basic HTML and HTML5 tutorial on freeCodeCamp.

Thoughts: Doubtful about whether I should keep working on front or back-end stuff, especially if I'll be able to find back-end projects to keep me motivated throughout.
